# Cloud Firestore Quickstart

## Introduction

Expiration Tracker is a expiration tracking app built on Cloud Firestore. It is based on the Firestore quickstart [here](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-js/blob/a4919505778ae280613662b5e0c64a0127a9d4c9/firestore/README.md), and still has many of the assets from that project because I didn't take the time to clean it up :P

## Setup and run the app

Follow these steps to setup and run the quickstart:

 1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
 1. In the Firebase console, enable Anonymous authentication on your project by doing: **Authentication > SIGN-IN METHOD > Anonymous > Enable > SAVE**
 1. In the Firebase console, enable Cloud Firestore on your project by doing: **Database > Create Database**
 1. Select testing mode for the security rules
 1. Copy/Download this repo and open this folder in a Terminal.
 1. Install the Firebase CLI if you do not have it installed on your machine:
    ```bash
    npm -g i firebase-tools
    ```
 1. Set the CLI to use the project you created on step 1:
    ```bash
    firebase use --add
    ```
 1. Deploy the Firestore security rules and indexes:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only firestore
    ```
 1. Run a local server:
    ```bash
    firebase serve
    ```
 1. As indicated, open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser and try out the app.
